# Uday Singamala
### My favorite vacation spot is santorini.

Surrounded by turquoise water, the Island is cluttered with **multi-colored cliffs, hot-headed volcanoes, and acres of sun-toasted sand**.<br>

Adding to the marvels of nature are the **ancient relics**, delectable cuisine, and adrenaline-pumping activities.<br>
